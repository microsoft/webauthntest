## Deploying to production
Things you need to deploy
- Create a app services web project
- Create a Cosmos DB with API mongodb

Before deploying, you'll need to define the following environment variables inside app services application settings so they can be accessed by this NODEJS app at runtime:
- MONGODB_URL - connection URL to your mongodb. Get it from cosmos db settings. Pick the latest Node.js 3.0 connection string under quick start.
- JWT_SECRET - some long random string
- HOSTNAME - hostname of your deployed service (e.g. "ctap.azurewebsites.net")
- ENFORCE_SSL_AZURE - set to "true"
